# Well-Being-App
This program allows you to interact with a bot, similar to a real person. The bot asks you about your day and learns more about your mental health. Then it provides you with guided meditation to try and help with any issues and calm your mind. After the meditation session, the bot will once again ask you about how you feel. Then you will be asked to make a reflection on your day and how you feel to better understand your thoughts. At the end the bot will try to comfort you and provide positive quotes and inspiration..

The program runs off of the main.py file and utilizes some external .mp3 files. Some .mp3 files on this repo are missing so code might not run properly.
